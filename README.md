# MathMage
Math Mage is a game developed from scratch without a game engine using Java's JSwing Application library. It is a wave-based top-down arena shooter where a math mage fights off hordes of monsters, undergoing trigonometry trials to gain boons in the form of exciting new weapons and power-ups. It is a fun way to learn your Trig Table for sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, and cot in degrees and radians! Hone your math skills and beat it as fast as you can in the hardest difficulty for a high score on the leaderboard. I created the UI and gameplay programming as well as art assets. The java project is hosted on Repl.it but can be downloaded and compiled to play on your computer.
