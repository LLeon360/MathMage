Every 10 waves you will face a boss battle where significantly stronger enemies will appear to challenge your strength.

Once you reach the end at Wave 30 or run out of health, you will be met with a game over screen where you can see previous scores 
and you will be given the choice to save your new score. Scores are rated based on the number of waves you survived, the 
difficulty you played on and how quickly you completed the game.

In the menu, you will be able to select a difficulty out of { Novice = 70 starting health, Skilled = 30 health, Master = 20 health }. Novice is 
recommended for new players. You can always change difficulty if you find the game too easy or too difficult.
